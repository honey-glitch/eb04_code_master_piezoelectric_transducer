It contains step by step procedure to run the simulator of virtual lab experiment
1.	Click on the simulation button to open the simulator.
2.	Switch ON the simulator Enable power button to work on the simulator.
3.	Then from the place equipments area select the equipments according to the instruction to make connection in the working canvas area.
4.	After placing the all equipment connect devices with wires.
5.	Once the circuit connection is completed then Switch on the supply of the circuit from switch given in middle window of second column and apply the pressure input.
6.	User will get output in the form of voltage in the multimeter reading window.
7.	Now start calibrating the output multimeter reading with the help of gain control knob of the differential amplifier.
8.	Once the multimeter is calibrated then output is shown numerically equal to the applied input pressure which is to be measured.
