Differential pressure is the difference between two referenced pressures. So gauge pressure is a type 
of differential pressure where the referenced pressure is atmospheric pressure. Generally all pressure 
measurements are differential. The reference can be zero as absolute pressure, atmospheric pressure, or 
any other pressure. <br><br>
Pressure transducers is generally classified into two types: gravitational and elastic types. In the gravitational
type, the manometer is the simplest device. In elastic transducers, the pressure exerts a force on the area of an 
elastic device. The force exerted on elastic member is the diaphragm, capsule, bellows or a bourdon tube. The 
resultant displacement of the membrane is measured with an appropriate electric sensor. The most commonly used 
pressure sensing element is the diaphragm. They are rugged, reliable  and have excellent stability.<br><br>
The Motorola pressure sensor is designed by utilizing a monolithic silicon piezo resistor, which produced 
the voltage according to the applied pressure. Applying pressure to the diaphragm, change in resistance of 
strain gauge takes place, which causes a change in the output voltage proportional to the applied pressure.
The strain gauge is an integral part  of the silicon diaphragm. <br><br>
Circuit diagram shown below is the steps of measurement of pressure using piezoelectric transducer. In this 
circuit firstly the known pressure is applied to piezoelectric transducer and output is shown in the digital
multimeter through the differential amplifier. Then calibration of digital multimeter is done with the help 
of gain control knob of differential amplifier so that it can show the output numerically equal to the input 
pressure. Once the calibration is done then user can easily get the value of applied pressure.
