#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student click on the simulation tab | Simulator screen of the experiment will open up  | To open the screen for performing the experiment.
2.| Draw the circuit diagram according to the circuit provided in the theoretical part by using the different blocks of instrument | Circuit is drawn accordingly in the simulator and input switch to apply the pressure is activated  | Circuit diagram is formed for which student have to provide  input to calculate the pressure in terms of voltage.
3.| Then student will select the various input pressure values. | According to the selected input output is shown on the digital voltmeter.  | To calculate the pressure by using the pressure transducer.
4.| Now the student will set the amplifier gain control in such a way that the output displayed is same as the input value. | Gain control knob is shown and selected and output value on the digital meter is displayed accordingly.  | Exact value of input pressure is shown as output in the digital meter.
5.| Then again student will select the various input pressure values. | Digital Voltmeter will show the voltage numerically equal to the selected input pressure  |To calculate the pressure by using the pressure transducer.
